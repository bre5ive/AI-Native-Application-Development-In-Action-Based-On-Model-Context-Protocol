## Introduction

AI is transforming the way we build applications. This repository provides a hands-on approach to developing AI-native applications. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), developers can create smarter, more adaptive applications that respond to user needs in real time. 

In this repository, you will find:

- Practical examples of AI-native application development.
- Guidance on implementing MCP.
- Resources for understanding AI concepts and technologies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bre5ive/AI-Native-Application-Development-In-Action-Based-On-Model-Context-Protocol.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for front-end development)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Key Features

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A framework for creating adaptive AI applications.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Process and respond to user input dynamically.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Easy-to-follow guides and tutorials.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For front-end dependencies, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start developing your AI-native application. Follow the examples in the `examples` directory to see how to implement various features using MCP.

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

For the front-end, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
